// Coding Guidlines

-> Use consistent naming convention camelCasing for variable names and for Classes , Structs and enum use PascalCase.
-> Use meaningful names.
-> Prefer maximum 2-3 arguments. If more needed, consider using a struct/class.
-> Follow Do Not Repeat Yourself Principle.
-> Properly handle errors.
-> Functions should not be more than 20-25 lines (Single Responsibility Principle).
-> Keep code formatted and indented properly.
-> Delete what is not required rather than just commenting it out.
-> Use UPPERCASE for constants.
-> Readability over conciseness.
